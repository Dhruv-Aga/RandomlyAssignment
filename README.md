# RandomlyAssignment

Problem Statement: Code a DHT (Distributed Hash Table).
Requirements:
1. Three APIs: put, get, del
2. Multiple clients can put, get or del to a server at the same time
NFR (Non-functional requirements):
1. Data reliability
2. Scalability
3. Fault tolerance
Items out of scope
1. Server-side sharding is not in scope. Implement a simple client-side sharding mechanism.
2. Networking is out of scope. Implement clients and servers in one process.
3. Service discovery is out of scope. A static config will do.
Demonstration/Testing
1. Code should be unit testable
2. Function to demonstrate the solution.
How will your code be judged?
1. Structure
2. APIs
3. Error handling
4. Low-level design
5. Logic
